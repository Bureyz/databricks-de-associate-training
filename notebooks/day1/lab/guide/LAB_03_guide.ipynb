    "### Task 5: DESCRIBE HISTORY\n",
    "- `DESCRIBE HISTORY table_name` shows all versions\n",
    "- Each operation creates a new version\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 6: Time Travel\n",
    "- By version: `SELECT * FROM table VERSION AS OF 2`\n",
    "- By timestamp: `SELECT * FROM table TIMESTAMP AS OF '2024-01-01'`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 7: RESTORE\n",
    "- `RESTORE TABLE table_name TO VERSION AS OF n`\n",
    "- Creates a NEW version (does not delete history)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 8: VACUUM\n",
    "- Default retention: 7 days\n",
    "- After VACUUM, time travel to versions older than retention fails\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you:\n",
    "- Performed MERGE to upsert customer data\n",
    "- Used UPDATE and DELETE for DML operations\n",
    "- Inspected the transaction log with DESCRIBE HISTORY\n",
    "- Queried historical data using time travel\n",
    "- Restored a table to a previous version\n",
    "- Understood VACUUM's impact on time travel\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Exam Tip:** MERGE is the key pattern for CDC/upsert. RESTORE creates a new version (non-destructive). VACUUM removes files older than retention period — after VACUUM, time travel to those versions fails. Default retention is 7 days.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **What's next:** Day 2 starts with LAB 04 — optimizing Delta tables with OPTIMIZE, Z-ORDER, VACUUM, and Liquid Clustering."
