    "## Detailed Hints\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 1: Update File\n",
    "- Read `customers_new.csv` using `spark.read` with CSV format\n",
    "- Compare `df_updates.count()` with base table count\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 2: MERGE INTO\n",
    "- Match condition: `target.customer_id = source.customer_id`\n",
    "- `WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET *`\n",
    "- `WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT *`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 3: UPDATE\n",
    "- `SET state = 'TX'` and `WHERE city = 'Austin'`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 5: DESCRIBE HISTORY\n",
    "- Command: `DESCRIBE HISTORY catalog.schema.table`\n",
    "- Look for operations: WRITE, MERGE, UPDATE, DELETE\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 6: Time Travel\n",
    "- Find the version number BEFORE the DELETE from the history\n",
    "- Use `VERSION AS OF {version_number}` in SELECT\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 7: RESTORE\n",
    "- `RESTORE TABLE ... TO VERSION AS OF {version_number}`\n",
    "- Use the same version as Task 6\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 8: VACUUM\n",
    "- `VACUUM table_name RETAIN 0 HOURS` (demo only, never in production!)\n",
    "- After VACUUM, querying old versions will fail — files are deleted\n",

    "\n",
    "In this lab you:\n",
    "- Used MERGE INTO for upsert (insert + update)\n",
    "- Performed UPDATE and DELETE on Delta tables\n",
    "- Inspected history with DESCRIBE HISTORY\n",
    "- Queried previous versions with Time Travel\n",
    "- Restored a table with RESTORE TABLE\n",
    "- Ran VACUUM and observed its impact on Time Travel\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Exam Tip:** Time Travel uses the Delta transaction log. Data files for old versions are only removed by `VACUUM`. Default retention is **7 days**. After VACUUM, `DESCRIBE HISTORY` still shows metadata, but querying old versions fails because the underlying Parquet files are gone.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **What's next:** In LAB 04 you will optimize Delta tables with OPTIMIZE, Z-ORDER, VACUUM, and Liquid Clustering."
